Tree Species Classification â€“ Week 1 (Edunet Green Skills Project)

Hi! This is my Week 1 submission for the Edunet Green Skills Internship.  
The project is about classifying different tree species using the dataset provided.

## âœ… Whatâ€™s Inside?
- **Tree_Species_Classification.ipynb** â€“ My Colab notebook with the code we learned in class.  
- **Dataset** â€“ Not uploaded here because itâ€™s a big file (you can download it from the link below).

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset Link
The dataset is stored on Google Drive (since itâ€™s too large for GitHub):  
ðŸ‘‰ [Click here to download the dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bc8Ne_e8Mgc3pLnq-dGYBqzpfHS0vQW5/view?usp=drivesdk)

# How to Use
1. Download or open the notebook (`.ipynb`) in Google Colab.
2. Run all the cells â€“ the code will handle downloading and preparing the dataset.
